I started with using the develop folder. From there, it looked like everything was in order to set up a script, but I was having a hard time trying to see why most of my css was working except for the color of the blocks. And then I realized I was missing the 'script src' at the end of my page.

The logic behind my script was to be able to achieve the same actions taken with the main homework. To be able to set up the page in order to read past, present, and future times while being able to edit each time block and have a corresponding button to save said blocks.

I wanted to also create a daily scheduler with a larger timeframe, so I took the code and created several more blocks of time in order to have a 6am-12am scheduler, because sleep doesn't exist. <!--jk>
